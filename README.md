# ZooKeeper-Master-Client

## Description

COMP512 Distributed System
A simple distributed computing platform following a master-worker(s) architecture that uses ZooKeeper for coordination. The high-level objective of the platform is that a client can submit a “task/job” for computation to the platform, which will execute the task/job using one of its many workers and provide the client with the result.

The workers are created under workers/worker.
